<h1>Ari</h1>
<p>Ari is here to help you create your website fast and easy. No technical skills required.</p>
<p>If you want to build a static website, Ari is your companion.</p>
<p>Ari focuses on aesthetics applied to simplicity. You have very few options to customise, making it really easy and straight forward.</p>
<p>This app is not aiming for web professionals, developers, neither designers. This app is targeting everyone else.</p>
<p>Write what you want to say, select the colours you want to use, see the results on the liver preview, upload your website in your preferred manner (Ari doesn't take care of uploading it or connecting with any server or cloud providers).</p>
